# BCI-Sentence-Silence-Spotter
This is the code to our Sentence spotter, Phoneme vs. Silence and Audio vs. Audio-visual models submitted to NER 2021 conference. 


In the first case, Sentence Spotter needs the data to be processed using TIMIT-MovieTrailer-SS-PS-model-data-loader.ipynb. This file processes the .fif file and
saves the EEG data as individual files based on the stimuli for each subject.
In the second case, Audio vs. Audio-visual model, the TIMIT-MovieTrailer-AV-model-data-loader.ipynb processes each .fif file and saves the EEG data as individual stimuli based on subject.
